	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<p>Jim Henson was born on September 24, 1936 in Greenville, Mississippi. From a young age his grandmother, a painter,
	encouraged his creative abilities. He began performing puppetry for audiences, including his friends in Cub Scouts very early on,
	inspired by the puppeteer Burr Tillstrom from televion. After high school, he attended the University of Maryland and as a freshman developed a five-minute show <i>Sam and Friends</i>
	which appeared on television, it later won a local Emmy. He graduated with degree in home economics. He stayed with the station broadcasting <i>Sam and Friends</i>
	for six years and eventually met his future-wife, Jane Nebel, while working there.</p>

	<h2>Television</h2>
	<p>After college Henson developed his muppets for commercial use, beginning with a successful series of commercials for Wilkins Coffee.
	In a commercial for IBM computers a character known as "Wheel Stealer" munched on the computers, he later became the Cookie Monster.
	Rowlf the Dog lead the way for the muppets with appearances in Purina commercials and on <i>The Jimmy Dean Show</i>.
	</p>
	<p>Henson's next experiment began in 1969 teaming up with Children's Television Workshop to create <i>Sesame Street</i>. 
	The show introduced classic characters including Big Bird, Grover, the Grouch, Bert, Ernie, Elmo and Snuffulupagus.
	He worked to engage and entertain children in this education-based program.</p>
	<p>His next success came in 1975 with the creation of <i>The Muppet Show</i> with the assistance of London-based
	producer Lord Lew Grade. The show premiered in 1976 introducing audiences to Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and the rest of the cast.
	With Kermit as the host and numerous celebrity guest stars, the show won three Emmy awards.</p>
	<p>He continued to develop new television shows after the success of <i>The Muppet Show</i>, including an animated spin-off series 
	<i>Jim Henson's Muppet Babies</i> which one four Emmys. He branched out beyond his original muppets with <i>Fraggle Rock</i> and <i>The Jim Henson Hour</i>.

	<h2>Film</h2>
	<p><i>The Muppet Show</i> soon led to <i>The Muppet Movie</i> in 1979 telling the story of Kermit and the muppets journey to Hollywood and quest for fame.
	In 1982, Henson created a darker, fantasy-adventure movie featuring his creatures with <i>The Dark Crystal</i>. The movie broke technological barriers through
	a combination of animation and puppetry. His next endeavor was <i>The Labyrinth</i> starring David Bowie as a Goblin King and produced by George Lucas. The movie
	was not well-received at the time and Henson's son Brian felt that was the closest he had been to losing his enduring positivity. The film has since gained a cult following.

	<h2>Legacy</h2>
	<p>The final project for Henson was an attraction for Disney theme parks in California and Florida, <i>Muppet*Vision 3D</i>.
	Henson unexpectedly passed away May 16, 1990 after a short battle with streptococcus pneumonia, an illness he concealed from
	his friends and family. His funeral served as a celebration of his life, featuring Big Bird singing "Bein' Green" and puppeteers
	saying goodbye with foam butterflies.</p>
	<p>Henson continues to influence puppetry thanks to his wife of thirty years, Jane Henson, who established The Jim Henson Legacy
	 and helped run the Jim Henson Foundation, which supports American puppet theatre. His children also continue to work with the Jim Henson
	 Company, his daughter Lisa as CEO and his son Brian as chair of the company.</p></div>
