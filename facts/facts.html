	<h2>Kermit the Frog</h2>
		<div class="box"><p>First created in 1955 for "Sam and Friends," Jim Henson described him as "literally my right hand." 
		Henson performed as Kermit up until his death in 1990 in shows and movies including 
		<i>Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, </i> and <i>The Muppets Take Manhattan.</i>
		He performed several hit songs including "Bein' Green" and "Rainbow Connection," which reached No. 25 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in 1979.
		</p></div>
	<h2>Rowlf the Dog</h2>
		<div class="box"><p>Despite Kermit's overwhelming fame, Rowlf was the first Muppet to become a star on <i>The Jimmy Dean Show</i>,
		 making his first appearance on September 19, 1963. He was the first Muppet to have a reoccurring role on network 
		 television and received thousands of fan letters each week.
		 Prior to that appearance he was used commercially for Purina Dog Chow.
		  He is known for being a pianist, performing the duet "I Hope That Somethin' Better Comes Along" with Kermit.

	<h2>The Swedish Chef</h2>
		<div class="box"><p>The Swedish Chef was first created by Jim Henson for <i>The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence</i> in 1975.
		He was one of the only Muppets that actually used the puppeteers hands and was also puppeteered by two people,
		beginning with Jim Henson and Frank Oz. Henson would perform the head and mock Swedish gibberish whil Oz would control the hands.
		</p></div>
	<h2>Dr.Teeth</h2>
		<div class="box"><p>Dr.Teeth appears as the keyboard player and gruff-voiced leader of the Muppet band,
		 Dr.Teeth and The Electric Mayhem debuting in <i>The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence</i> 
		 His trademark gold tooth is rumored to be made from his melted down gold records.
		 His introductory lines from <i>The Muppet Movie</i> were "Golden teeth and golden tones, welcome to my presence."
		 Jim Henson was initially inspired by musician Dr. John when creating Dr.Teeth.
		 </p></div>
	<h2>Waldorf</h2>
		<div class="box"><p>Waldorf made his debut on the pilot episode <i>The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence</i> 
		like many of the Muppets Henson performed. A crouchy, outspoken, old man Muppet, Waldorf is 
		typically paired with his equally opinionated friend Statler. Both heckle Fozzie Bear's
		comedy routines throughout the show and frequently break the fourth wall to complain
		directly to the audience.</p> </div>
	<h2>Link Hogthrob</h2>
		<div class="box"><p>Created in 1977 for <i>The Muppet Show</i>, Link Hogthrob is a slow-witted
		pig inspired by the stereotypical leading man with flowing curls and a strong jawline.
		He is the star of the <i>Pigs in Space</i> sketch along with his first mate, Miss Piggy.
		He was featured several times with solo performances of songs including "I Talk to the Trees" and "Sonny Boy." </p> </div>
	<h2>Ernie</h2>
		<div class="box"><p>Created for the test pilot of <i>Sesame Street</i> in 1969 Ernie along with his roommate, Bert, 
		are just one example of many Muppet pairings performed by Henson and his good friend Frank Oz. Oz began working with Henson in 
		1963 after Jane Henson quit working with the Muppets to raise children. 27 years together created the iconic duos of Bert and Ernie,
		Kermit and Miss Piggy, or Kermit and Fozzie. Finally, when George Lucas asked Henson to create Yoda for <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>
		Henson declined but recommended Oz who voiced and performed Yoda, receiving a nomination for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award.</p></div>
